# Authority Configuration for SifterSearch
# ==========================================
#
# Authority represents doctrinal weight on a scale of 1-10:
#   10 = Central Figure revelation (Bahá'u'lláh, The Báb, etc.)
#    9 = Authoritative interpretation (Shoghi Effendi, 'Abdu'l-Bahá)
#    8 = Institutional guidance (Universal House of Justice, etc.)
#    7 = Official compilations and study materials
#    6 = Reference works and authoritative secondary sources
#    5 = Published books by scholars
#    4 = Historical documents
#    3 = Research papers and studies
#    2 = News, essays, and personal writings
#    1 = Pilgrim notes and unverified sources
#
# Documents can override their collection's default authority.
# Search results are boosted by authority to surface important texts first.

# Default authority for documents without a specific collection
default_authority: 5

# Religion-level defaults (applied if collection not specified)
# Include both accented and non-accented versions for matching
